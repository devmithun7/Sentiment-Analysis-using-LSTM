1. data_parallel - folder for code with DDP
2. data_and_model_parallel - folder for code with DDP and model parallel with CPUs
3. data_parallel_and_AMP - folder with code for DDP and AMP
4. dataset - Dataset folder
5. POC Notebooks - play area notebooks before final modeling
6. speedup and efficiency.ipynb - this is the comparison between different CPU runs, speedup, efficiency and Dask vs Pandas

inside each folder i.e. data_parallel, data_and_model_parallel 
.ipynb - file to execute the code (run from inside the folder)
data_processing.py - Dask data processing
model.py - model defination
utils.py - utility fucntion
train_model.py - train the model 
evaluate_model.py - evaluate the model
main.py - use mp for execution

dask_report - data processing report
logs - log file with execution times
saved_model - exported models and the performance
