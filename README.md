## 🎯 Project Overview
This project implements scalable sentiment analysis on **3.5M+ Amazon customer reviews** using parallel data processing and distributed deep learning.  
Techniques such as **Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP)**, **model parallelism**, and **Dask-based preprocessing** were evaluated to measure their impact on **training time, speedup, and efficiency**.

The goal is to understand how parallel computing techniques accelerate large-scale NLP workloads and optimize resource utilization.

## ⚡ Parallel Processing Techniques

### **1️⃣ Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)**

**Concept:**  
Replicate model across processes, each handling unique data shards.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Initialize process group
- Wrap model with `DistributedDataParallel`
- Use `DistributedSampler` for balanced dataset splits
- Synchronize gradients via all-reduce

**Benefits:**
- Near-linear scaling at smaller CPU counts
- No model architecture changes needed

---

### **2️⃣ Model Parallelism**

**Concept:**  
Split model layers across multiple CPU devices.

**Device Allocation Example:**
- Device 0: Embedding, FC
- Device 1: LSTM

**Benefits:**
- Better utilization of multiple devices
- Reduces load on single CPU
- Useful for large models

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher communication overhead
- Less efficient if model fits comfortably on one CPU

## 📊 Results & Analysis

### **DDP Performance**
| CPUs | Training Time (min) |
|------|----------------------|
| 8    | 263                  |
| 16   | ~180                 |
| 24   | ~135                 |
| 28   | Higher due to overhead |

**Insights:**
- Training time nearly **cuts in half** from 8 → 24 CPUs
- Best speedup: **1.95×**
- Efficiency decreases with CPU count due to synchronization costs

---

### **DDP + Model Parallel Performance**
- Best performance at **16 CPUs**
- Unstable results at **20 CPUs** due to communication overhead
- Peak speedup: **1.82×**
- Slightly better efficiency at high CPU counts compared to DDP-alone

---

### **Data Preprocessing Performance**
| Tool   | Time (sec) |
|--------|------------|
| Dask   | ~30        |
| Pandas | ~80        |

Dask demonstrates **~3× faster** preprocessing on large files.
